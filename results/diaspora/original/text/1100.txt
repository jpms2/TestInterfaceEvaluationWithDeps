Feature: Keyboard navigation
In order not to have to move my hand to the mouse
As a user
I want to be able to navigate the stream by keyboard
Background:
Given many posts from alice for bob
And I sign in as "bob@bob.bob"
Scenario: navigate downwards on a profile page
When I am on "alice@alice.alice"'s page
And I press the "J" key somewhere
Then post 1 should be highlighted
And I should have navigated to the highlighted post
When I press the "J" key somewhere
Then post 2 should be highlighted
And I should have navigated to the highlighted post
