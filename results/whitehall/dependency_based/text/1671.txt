Feature: governments
As an editor
I want to be able to associate content with a specific government
So that we can appropriately identify less relevant content after elections.
Scenario: creating a government
Given I am a GDS admin
When I create a government called "2005 to 2010 Labour government" starting on "06/05/2005"
Then there should be a government called "2005 to 2010 Labour government" starting on "6 May 2005"
Scenario: editing a government's start and end dates
Given a government exists called "2005 to 2010 Labour government" between dates "06/05/2004" and "11/05/2009"
And I am a GDS admin
When I edit the government called "2005 to 2010 Labour government" to have dates "06/05/2005" and "11/05/2010"
Then there should be a government called "2005 to 2010 Labour government" between dates "6 May 2005" and "11 May 2010"
