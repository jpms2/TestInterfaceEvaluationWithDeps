Scenario: User filters by "Statistics" which returns Official Statistics and National statistics
Given a published publication "Road accidents" with type "Official Statistics"
And a published publication "National road accidents" with type "National Statistics"
When I filter the publications list by "Statistics"
Then I should see "Road accidents" in the result list
And I should see "National road accidents" in the result list
