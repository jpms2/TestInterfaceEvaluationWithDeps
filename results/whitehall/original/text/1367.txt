Feature: Tagging content with specialist sectors
In order to make my content available to users with specialist needs
As a departmental content editor
I want to be able to tag my content to one or more specialist sectors
Scenario: sectors are shown on tagged content
Given there is a document tagged to specialist sectors
When I view the document
Then I should see the specialist sub-sector and its parent sector
Feature: Policy groups
As a citizen:
I want to be able to follow a link from policy documents to the profile of any groups who are influencing the policy
So I can see how outside experts and stakeholders are involved in making the policy
Done means:
- It is possible to create 'Policy groups' and associate them to policies
- multiple policy groups can be associated to a single policy
- doing so results in a line of metadata on the policy page, below the one for a policy team, which reads "Groups: [Title of group as a link]" with the +others JavaScript behaviour for multiple items.
- An group page comprises:
- Title
- Summary
- Description (markdown field)
- Contact email
- Attachments (placed inline using markdown)
- consistent with the policy teams design, the H2s are pulled out into a contents list as anchor links
Background:
Given I am an editor
Scenario: Policy groups appear in the public index
Given a policy group "ABC Advisories" exists
When I visit the policy group index
Then I should see the policy group "ABC Advisories" in the index
