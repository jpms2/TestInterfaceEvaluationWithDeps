Feature: News article specific to native language speakers
As an publisher dealing with world wide content (eg FCO),
I want the ability to publish a News article without having to have an English language edition,
So that I do not need to spend the time translating content into English
-------
Some content is only for audiences local to the location and so an English version is not relevant or desired.
Background:
Given I am a GDS editor
Scenario: Create a News article in a non-English language
Given a world location "France" exists with a translation for the locale "Fran√ßais"
When I draft a French-only news article associated with "France"
Then I should see the news article listed in admin with an indication that it is in French
When I publish the French-only news article
Then I should only see the news article on the French version of the public "France" location page
