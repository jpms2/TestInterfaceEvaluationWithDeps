Feature: Manage deferred todos
In order to hide todos that require attention in the future and not now
As a Tracks user
I want to defer these and manage them in a tickler
Background:
Given the following user record
| login    | password | is_admin |
| testuser | secret   | false    |
Scenario: Opening the tickler page shows the deferred todos in order
Given I have a deferred todo "show tomorrow" in the context "Context B" deferred by 1 day
And I have a deferred todo "show in a year" in the context "Context B" deferred by 365 days
And I have a deferred todo "show in a week" in the context "Context B" deferred by 7 days
When I go to the tickler page
Then I should see "show tomorrow" before "show in a week"
And I should see "show tomorrow" before "show in a year"
And I should see "show in a week" before "show in a year"
