Feature: Edit a context
In order to work on todos in a context
As a Tracks user
I want to manage todos in a context
Background:
Given the following user record
| login    | password | is_admin |
| testuser | secret   | false    |
@javascript
Scenario: I can change the name of the context and it should update the new todo form
When I go to the context page for "@pc"
And I edit the context name in place to be "OutAndAbout"
Then the context field of the new todo form should contain "OutAndAbout"
@javascript
Scenario: I can change the name of the context and it should still allow me to add new actions
When I go to the context page for "@pc"
And I edit the context name in place to be "OutAndAbout"
And I submit a new action with description "a new next action"
Then I should see the todo "a new next action"
