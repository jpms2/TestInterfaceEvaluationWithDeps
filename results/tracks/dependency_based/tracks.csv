For example, message/rfc822 for email was being replaced by application/html causing wrong application to be started on the client. , Fasterer: Use &:symbol is faster  Calling argumentless methods within blocks is slower than using symbol to proc. , fasterer: hash#fetch with block is faster  hash#fetch with block is faster than hash#fetch with second parameter , fasterer: Use attr_reader for reading ivars. , Fasterer: Parallel assignment is slower  Parallel assignment is slower than sequential assignment.
